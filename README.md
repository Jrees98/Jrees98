- 👋 Hi, I’m Jacob!
  I am 24 years old and a recent graduate from Brigham Young University. I graduated with a degree in Business Management and currently work in accounting.
  Over the last few months I have found a passion for programming and have decided that I would like to transition into this field. Ideally this would be
  sometime next summer. Nearly all my free time is used learning programming. I love the problem solving and constant learning that this field provides.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  Python through Angela Yu's 100 days of Python Udemy course.
  Javascript through Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp as well as the Odin Project.

- ⛷️When I'm not coding or working I like to:
  Ski, go on hikes, golf, and play hockey.

- 📫 How to reach me:
  Feel free to send me an email at reescodes@gmail.com
  I'd love to hear from you!
